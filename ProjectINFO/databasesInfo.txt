## Handling issues with devices that have been assigned too many times

1. Go to the database and change the mac address of previously deactivated devices so they don't match the sql query

- Don't change the one with 'active flag = 1' set.
- sometimes it times out but it still goes through
- the next time you  try to unassign, pay attention to the logs, and if the error message is "object reference not found", it was already deleted on the Withings server side

- in this case, you can change in the DB in patient monitor table "active = 0"
- And then also, search the first table below for all data related to the device using patient_monitor_entity_id. And for any returns, you can safely remove them.

- and if it has only 1 device showing, then you should then remove data from the 2nd table as well, using the patient_entity_id to search

## Databases that need updating when unassigning a device

patient_monitor_entity_monitor_properties

patient_entity_patient_properties
